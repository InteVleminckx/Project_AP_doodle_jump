# Project_AP_doodle_jump

## Introduction
This is a school project consists of designing and implementing an interactive game, inspired by Doodle Jump, in C++ and using the SFML graphics library. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate that we are able to create a well-designed architecture, fully utilize advanced C++ features and provide high-quality code that implements the requirements.

## Code Conventions: Naming
- Classes, class methods, functions, typedef or namespace names start with a capital letter. The "main" is an exception to this.
- Names for variables, class data members, function parameters, etc. should all be lowercase. If there are names where the name is a concatenation of several words the next word may start with a capital letter to make it more readable. Start data member names with an "m_" prefix and for static data member names with an "s_".
