## Code Conventions
### Naming
    - Classes, class methods, functions, typedef or namespace names start with an upper case. The name "main" is the unavoidable exception.
    - Names for variables, class data members, function parameters, etc. must be all lower case. Start names for data member with a "m_" prefix and for static data member names with a "s_".
